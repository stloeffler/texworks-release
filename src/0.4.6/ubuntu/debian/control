Description: simple interface for working with TeX documents
 An environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc) documents, with a
 Unicode-based, TeX-aware editor, integrated PDF viewer, and a clean, simple
 interface accessible to casual and non-technical users.
 .
 TeXworks is inspired by Dick Koch's award-winning TeXShop program for Mac OS X,
 which has made quality typesetting through TeX accessible to a wider community
 of users, without a technical or intimidating face. The goal of TeXworks is to
 deliver a similarly integrated, easy-to-use environment for users on other
 platforms, especially GNU/Linux and Windows.
