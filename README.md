TeXworks release scripts
========================

This repository contains some scripts (mostly [Python](https://www.python.org/)
and bash) to help me automate the building and publishing process of
[TeXworks](http://www.tug.org/texworks/) binaries. The scripts are intended to
run on *nix and were tested on Ubuntu. Currently supported are builds for
Windows and Ubuntu.

These scripts are licensed under GPL v2 or later license (in accordance with the
TeXworks license).
